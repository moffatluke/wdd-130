        Hey, my name is Luke Moffat! I am from Vernon Hills, IL, but most of the time I say Chicago because the city is so close to me. 
        I am a computer science major and this is my second semester. I enjoy music a lot, I play trombone and piano and sing. 
        I love to sing in choir and listen to a variety of genres of music. My favorite food is ice cream! 
        My whole family makes homemade icec ream all the time so I guess that's where I get that from. I love the community here at BYUI. 
        Everyone supports each other and is friendly. I am taking this course because I am deciding if I want to stick with computer science as a major and also enjoy coding.
